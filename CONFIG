VFM_USE_NEXT_POINTER
	Use a pointer to the inner interpreter (fetch next instruction).
	This is used to implement instruction tracing, coverage and profiling.

VFM_USE_INLINE_NEXT
	If a pointer to the inner interpreter is not used, performance may
	be improved by inlining the normal inner interpreter. This grows the
	code size and may exhaust the instruction cache.
